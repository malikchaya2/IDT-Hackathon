## Project Description
The lyrics generator helps users write their own songs by generating lyrics based on a theme they choose.  The user first chooses one of the following themes:  <br>
Happy  <br>
Angry  <br>
Sad  <br>
Excited  <br>
InLove  <br>
Scared  <br>
The user then chooses from a choice of sub themes. Once a subtheme is chosen, the user either chooses one of the four generated sentences to append to their song, or chooses a different subtheme for more options.
